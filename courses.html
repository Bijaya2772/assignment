			<div class="entry">
				<p>The BTEC <strong>(Business and Technology Education Council)</strong> qualifications are flexible – you can take one alongside (or instead of) GCSEs and A levels in schools and colleges. They’re also usually studied full-time, either in college or jointly between a school and a college.
                  BTECs are divided into units, which cover specific areas of knowledge, skills, and understanding required by the particular sector or industry. </p>
				<p>Entry requirements vary depending on the school or college and the particular BTEC course you are interested in. You may need up to five GCSEs at grade A* to C.On successful completion of a BTEC National qualification, students can progress to employment or continue their learning in the same or related areas of study, in higher education and professional development programmes.  </p>
